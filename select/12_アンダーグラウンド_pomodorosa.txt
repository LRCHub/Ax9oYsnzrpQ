I am waiting for the train
I don't know where the train
Goes to for carry me out to wonder stories
It weird well you are thinking so

In the future you will hear the sound of the train
Heart beats up too fast, fast and strong
Somewhere nobody knows something is it real?
Well i am thinking so

I don't care, i don't care where i go
Ever go through the underground
There our the darkness and reach home the world
We don't care, best anymore no dime

No more ones madness and masking people
I don't care, i don't care where i go, ever
Go through the underground
Whenever my gas is could get cold
